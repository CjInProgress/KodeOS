# image, its data folder on the FAT, where Apps reads its icon, colour and
# description. The release refuses an image or a folder whose stamp is not the
# pin. Run it before `idf.py build`: the FAT image is made by that build.
#
# The welcome app lives in its own repository and builds with its own SDK pin,
# so like the C5's firmware it is the one image here that `idf.py build`
# cannot make. The pin is one line, "<repository> <app folder> <commit>";
# moving it is a deliberate change, the same as moving the C5's.

#   exit:  0 on success, 1 if the pin cannot be read, the source is not at the
