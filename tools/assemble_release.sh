# Turns a finished `idf.py build` into the four release artifacts kodeOS
# ships on GitHub: the factory pack (the files this release's
# erase-everything flash writes, per https://docs.kode.diy/internals/boot-model,
# the apps region with the welcome app installed among them, plus
# a flash.sh, a README.txt covering the same ground and the
# THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt for what kodeos.bin contains), kodeos.bin
# standalone, for `os update` or the mailbox, and the welcome app's image and
# its app data, to install it again on a board that lost it. Used by
# .github/workflows/release.yml; safe to run locally too, e.g. to check what
# a release would contain before tagging.
#
#   usage: tools/assemble_release.sh <version> [<build_dir>] [<out_dir>] [<apps_dir>]
#     version   e.g. 00.00.02 - no leading "v", see validate_release_tag.sh
#     build_dir default: build   (idf.py's output directory)
#     out_dir   default: dist
#     apps_dir  default: apps_image (holds <CONFIG_KODEOS_WELCOME_APP>.bin)
#   exit: 0 on success, 1 if a required input file is missing,
#         kodeos.bin is past its ceiling (tools/check_os_size.sh),
#         the FAT does not carry exactly kode/, the C5 image the SDK pins and
#         the welcome app's data folder, or the welcome app's image is not
#         the project the build names, or the image or that data folder is not
#         the one tools/build_welcome.sh stamped from apps_image/welcome.pin
